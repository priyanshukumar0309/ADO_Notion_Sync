# My Notion Azure Devops Sync App
This is a Streamlit app that integrates Notion and Azure DevOps (ADO) to automate the synchronization of work items, ensuring that both systems are up-to-date. It fetches and updates work items between ADO and Notion, creates missing items, and synchronizes descriptions. The app also facilitates the addition of required columns in Notion and tracks the sync status of items.

## How to run:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run main.py`
